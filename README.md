Introduction

For our project we wanted to investigate mainly the relationship between temperature change and environ- mental factors. Our goal was to find out if changes in global temperature in recent years are natural or are affected by human behavior. We are interested in this because global warming has become a serious issue in recent years and we want to determine if we should be concerned with sudden changes in temperature.

Project Dataset Description Dataset

To conduct our research we used the “Jena Climate” dataset from Kaggle. The data is a weather time series dataset recorded at the Weather Station of the Max Planck Institute for Biogeochemistry in Jena, Germany. We did some data cleaning of the dataset by changing column names to make it easier for ourselves to navigate the data. The dataset comprises a wide variety of meteorological variables such as atmospheric pressure, humidity, wind speed, wind direction, and more. We found that this dataset was appropriate for our research as it is very large, containing 420,551 observations, with each observation recorded within a ten minute time interval. This data is also fairly recent as each observation was taken from the start of 2009 all the way to the end of 2016 therefore, the conclusions we were able to draw from this data are reliable and can be related to the current global climate. We assume that this dataset provides an accurate representation of temperature and climate globally; however, we understand that the location of the weather station may not be directly representative of conditions in other areas.

Objectives

Our objective is to answer our main research question as well as these sub questions:
1. Which environmental factor impacts the correlation between temperature and other environmental factors?
2. Is there a relationship between temperature and air density?
3. How does the number of predictors of environmental factors impact overall performance of our response variable temperature?
4. What factors can we use to predict wind-speed?
